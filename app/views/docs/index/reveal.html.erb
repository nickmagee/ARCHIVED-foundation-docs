  			<h3>Reveal &mdash; Simple, Flexible Modal Dialogs</h3>
  			<h4 class="subheader">Modal dialogs, or pop-up windows, are handy for prototyping and production. Foundation includes Reveal our jQuery modal plugin, to make this easy for you.</h4>

				<p><a href="#" data-reveal-id="exampleModal" class="radius button">Example Modal&hellip;</a></p>

				<h4>Using Reveal</h4>
				<p>Reveal is easy to hook up. Include the JS and CSS in your <code>head</code> (both of which are included in foundation.css and foundation.js, if you use the downloaded code pack). You can either call it in the JS or include a "data-reveal-id" parameter. Here are the steps to get started:</p>

			  <h5>Markup</h5>
				<p><strong>Remember:</strong> your modal should be at the end of the page, after any of your rows or columns.</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/2955944.js?file=f3-reveal-example.html"></script>

				<h5>Calling Reveal</h5>
	   		<p>There are two ways to do call a Reveal modal. The first is to attach a handler to something (button most likely) then call Reveal:</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/2955951.js?file=f3-reveal.html"></script>

				<p>The new hotness: just add a data-reveal-id to the object which you want to fire the modal when clicked...</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/2955957.js?file=f3-reveal-id.html"></script>

				<p>This will launch the modal with the ID "myModal2" without attaching a handler or calling the plugin (since the plugin is always listening for this). You can also pass any of the parameters simply by putting a data-nameOfParameter="value" (i.e. data-animation="fade")</p>

			<h4>Sizes</h4>
			<p>Out of the box, reveal supports a few different sizes, those are:<br> <kbd>small</kbd> <kbd>medium</kbd> <kbd>large</kbd> <kbd>xlarge</kbd> <kbd>expand</kbd></p>
				<hr />

				<h4>Options</h4>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/2956001.js?file=f3-reveal-options.js"></script>

				<p>Options can be used on the "data-reveal-id" implementation too, just do it like this:</p>

				<script src="https://gist.github.com/2956006.js?file=f3-reveal-data-options.html"></script>

  		</div>
  		<div class="four columns">
  		  <%= render "download" %>
  		</div>
    </div>
	</section>

	<%= render "sidebar" %>
</div>

<div id="exampleModal" class="reveal-modal">
  <h2>This is a modal.</h2>
  <p>Reveal makes these very easy to summon and dismiss. The close button is simple an anchor with a unicode character icon and a class of <code>close-reveal-modal</code>. Clicking anywhere outside the modal will also dismiss it.</p>
  <p>Finally, if your modal summons another Reveal modal, the plugin will handle that for you gracefully.</p>
  <p><a href="#" data-reveal-id="secondModal" class="secondary button">Second Modal&hellip;</a></p>
  <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>
</div>

<div id="secondModal" class="reveal-modal">
  <h2>This is a second modal.</h2>
  <p>See? It just slides into place after the other first modal. Very handy when you need subsequent dialogs, or when a modal option impacts or requires another decision.</p>
  <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>
</div>
